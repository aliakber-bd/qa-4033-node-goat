If you only use HashMap or HashSet and your XML refers these only as default map or set, you may additionally change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util.Set at unmarshalling time::\n> \n> xstream.addDefaultImplementation(java.util.TreeMap.class, java.util.Map.class);\n> xstream.addDefaultImplementation(java.util.TreeSet.class, java.util.Set.class);\n> However, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.\n\n\n\n## References\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-674](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/674.html)\n\n","text":"XStream is vulnerable to denial-of-service due to a stack overflow that exists due to a recursive hash set calculation.
