The mechanism is active when a custom regex pattern is not provided. This change was made available in:\n* [**6.3.0**](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v6.3.0) with [this](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/commit/f1253b47b347dcb909e3e80b0eb2649109e59894) commit,\n* [**3.3.0**](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v3.3.0) with [this](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/commit/d31670ae8f6e69cbfd56e835742195b7d10942ef) commit,\n* [**1.9.0**](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v1.9.0) with [this](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/commit/925ac8e3c5780b02f58cbd4e52f95da8ad2ac485) commit,\n* [**0.1.12**](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v0.1.12) with [this](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/commit/f01c26a013b1889f0c217c643964513acf17f6a4) commit.\n\n**Warning**: The \"backtracking protection\" mechanism does not protect against vulnerable user-supplied capture groups. The vendor considers protecting against explicit user-supplied patterns to be out of scope for old versions. The \"backtracking protection\" measures can also be considered a breaking change for some users.\n\nThe latest stable releases are available [here](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases).\n\n## Workaround\nVersion [**7.1.0**](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v7.1.0) offers a non-default `strict` option that can be enabled with `strict: true` in order to receive errors where a regular expression that may cause regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) issues is detected. This feature is documented [here](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/blob/v7.1.0/Readme.md#developers).\n\nAside from the workaround provided in this release, the vendor has also provided the following workaround advice in their [advisory](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/security/advisories/GHSA-9wv6-86v2-598j) that can be applied manually:\n\n> All versions can be patched by providing a custom regular expression for parameters after the first in a single segment. As long as the custom regular expression does not match the text before the parameter, you will be safe. For example, change `/:a-:b` to `/:a-:b([^-/]+)`.\n> \n> If paths cannot be rewritten and versions cannot be upgraded, another alternative is to limit the URL length. For example, halving the attack string improves performance by 4x faster.\n\n\n\n## Dependency tree\n- owasp-nodejs-goat/1.3.0/-npm\n    - express/4.16.4\n        - path-to-regexp/0.1.7\n\n\n## References\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-407](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/407.html)\n\n","text":"Path-to-RegExp is vulnerable to a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) issue due to how it is possible for an inefficient expression to be generated for some routes that make use of named parameters.\n\nThe expression generated from affected routes is susceptible to excessive backtracking.
